          <h2>Retro is Back: Timex Intrepid Dimepiece</h2>
          <p>Date: August 2025</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Short description:</strong> Timex, in collaboration with
            Dimepiece, has reimagined the iconic Intrepid model from 1995 in a
            modern, gender-neutral 36 mm version.

            he new Timex Intrepid Dimepiece brings the spirit of the 1990s into
            2025. Inspired by the sailing watch once loved by John F. Kennedy
            Jr., the updated design combines retro aesthetics with today’s
            inclusivity trends. The 36 mm case makes the watch equally
            comfortable for men and women, moving the focus away from “feminine”
            or “masculine” colors and toward pure functionality and style.
            Priced at $239, it has quickly gained popularity among
            fashion-oriented collectors who appreciate both nostalgia and modern
            design.

          <h2>Watches & Wonders 2025: Key Trends in Modern Watchmaking</h2>
          <p>Date: August 2025</p>
          <p>The largest watch fair of the year showcased innovation, compact designs, and bold use of colors.</p>
          <details><summary>Read more</summary>
          Watches & Wonders 2025 gathered over 60 brands, making it the biggest edition yet. This year’s highlights include ultra-precise 5 Hz mechanical movements presented by Rolex, Grand Seiko, Parmigiani, and Chopard. Another trend is compact cases — Rolex introduced the Land-Dweller, and brands like TAG Heuer, Cartier, and Chopard followed with smaller, more wearable designs. Color took center stage: pastel shades, candy-tone dials, and warm gold hues such as “Honeygold” dominated the show. At the high end, Patek Philippe impressed with its Quadruple Complication, while Vacheron Constantin unveiled the Solaria Ultra. Overall, the exhibition showed how watchmaking combines technical mastery with playful creativity.
